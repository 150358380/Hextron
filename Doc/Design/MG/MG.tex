\section{Introduction}
This is the module guide for the remake Hextris, an altered version of a open sourced online game that adds elements of tetris to a hexagon based reaction game. This guide is for the explanation of the design as well as the breakdown of the various modules used in the creation of the game. The document is also used to improve updates and fixes breaking down the game into more manageable chunks for future developers and designers to use. It also lends itself to allow for an easier time for  validating the requirements set by the SRS in decomposing the projects. The module guide complements the MIS document in providing a better explanation of the separate functions and classes provided by the MIS. 

\subsection{Overview}
The document will begin with the changes as well as the confirmed differences to our project highlighting the new differences and what was kept the same. The document will then list and explain the decomposition of the various modules. The document will then go over the module hierarchy, finishing with a traceability matrix.



\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes}
The following section outlines the changes that were made to the project. Some of these changes are ones we anticipated and some are unlikely changes.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes}
As the project goes on, the team discover certain aspects of the project that need to be changed in the future. These anticipated changes are all changes that are to be executed by modifying a single module for each change. The following is a list of anticipated changes the team has determined to be necessary for the completion of the project.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{AC\arabic*:}]
\item Decreasing the amount of block variations to be added to the final product.
\item Development a block destruction algorithm.
\item Decrease the scope of some of the features to be added for the user interface.
\item Added implementation of a fill algorithm for usage when matching blocks are to be found.
\item Added implementation of a fill algorithm for usage when matching blocks are to be found.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes}
During the implementation and production of the product, certain things problems arise that facilitate the need for a modification to a certain module. These problems can be resolved through modifications to the modules respective to each problem. These problems cause the need for changes that were not expected to be made by the team prior to the implementation.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{UC\arabic*:}]
\item Certain animation to the hexagon object will be omitted.
\item Physics of the trapezoids will need to be modified to restrict unwanted movement.
\item Player controls and menu interface remains unchanged.
\item Added background music for a more appealing interface when the game is being played.
\item The pause button was changed from ‘P’ to the Space Bar.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Module Hierarchy}
The following section is an overview of the modules to be implemented in the final product. The modules are categorized into three categories; Hardware-Hiding Modules, Behaviour-Hiding Modules, and Software Decision Modules. The following is a table detailing the decomposition of the modules into their respective categories.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{M\arabic*:}]
\item HexagonBehaviour(Player Controller) - This module dictates the movement and modification of the hexagon game object within the game.
\item LevelManager - This module manages the boot processes of the game.
\item MusicPlayer - This module finds and plays the music file while the game is being played.
\item PauseManager - This module implements the pause functionality of the game.
\item Spawner - This module generates a trapezoid of a random colour and a random location of the six defined locations to be dropped in the game.
\item TrapezoidBehaviour - This module handles the main physics of the trapezoids that are to be dropped onto the hexagon object. This includes the motion, scaling, collision, and position of the trapezoids. This module includes two scripts; TrapezoidTransform and TrapezoidCollision.
\item Game Interface - This module handles the drawing of the various game objects as well as the various screens. Additionally it handles the frame to frame updates keeping track of time and score. Mostly of the Game interface is embedded and linked with the unity engine.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design}
Certain design decisions needed to be made in order to facilitate the requirements outlined in the SRS documentation. For the random trapezoid generation functionality, the team decided to choose between one of four colours and one of six positions for each face of the hexagon. The movement function requirement of the trapezoids was facilitated through setting a velocity vector for each trapezoid pointing to the center of the hexagon. The speed of the falling trapezoids increasing was designed by increasing the magnitude of the velocity vector by a scaling factor that is directly related to the total time the current game is running. The game will support up to eight trapezoids stacked up on each face of the hexagon. A limit was set on the hexagon and is to be checked each time a new block is dropped. If the height of the stack exceeds eight trapezoids, then the game would end. The rotation of the hexagon was is to be controlled by the user. The decision made was that the rotation is to be controlled by the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard. The left arrow key rotates the hexagon by 60 degrees to the left and the right arrow key rotates the hexagon by 60 degrees to the right. For the pause functionality of the game, the team decided to set the time scale value in the code to 0 to simulate the freezing of time in the game. The above requirements and their corresponding design decisions were made by the team to ensure the quality and the completion of the project.

\section{Module Decomposition}
The following section outlines each module defined above in more detail. The section talks about the secrets and services of each module. It also outlines what the module was implemented by. The section discusses certain aspects of each module that pertains to the functionality of the module in question.

\subsection{Hardware Hiding Modules}

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules}
Use Hierarchy between Modules: This section explains some of the interaction between the various modules. Starting with the level manager which is responsible for the startup assets of the game and the instantiation of most of the other modules. The Hexagon behaviour, Trapezoid behaviour, Game interface and Music player is then used. The spawner is non dependent on most of the other modules, continuously creating blocks until the game is paused or the game is stopped. Trapezoids generated are taken by the trapezoid behaviour which then scales and applies gravity to the blocks. Colliding with the player, the player control dictates the movement of the center hexagon. All the modules operate under the game interface which is unity’s platform for frame updates and time tracking. Music player is also an independent module that provides the background music regardless the processes of the other modules.
